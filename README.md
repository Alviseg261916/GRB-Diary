### :star2: Project Description

This application is a digital diary developed entirely in Python, using CustomTkinter for the graphical interface and SQL for data management. Unlike traditional CustomTkinter-based applications, the pvInStyle library has been integrated here, enabling smooth animations such as fade-in and fade-out, as well as advanced page management. Thanks to this integration, each button can control entire pages with multiple complex elements instead of single widgets, making the interface more dynamic, modern, and structured. Additionally, by using SQL, the application supports multiple users, each with their own personal password to access the diary in a private and secure manner.

This application is not intended for distribution: it is a proof of concept developed to demonstrate to myself that Python is capable of handling lightweight yet functional GUIs, even with complex animations and pages.
