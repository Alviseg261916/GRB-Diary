## About the Project

### Project Description

This application is a side project that i've made for my girlfriend made completely in Python. It's a digital diary featuring a CustomTkinter graphical interface and an SQL back end for robust data management. Uniquely, it incorporates the pvInStyle libraryâ€”enabling smooth fade-in/fade-out animations and sophisticated page transitions. As a result, each button can orchestrate entire pages of complex elements rather than single widgets, yielding a more dynamic, modern, and well-structured user experience.
The use of SQL authentication allows multiple users to maintain separate, password-protected diaries, ensuring privacy and security.

Originally conceived as a personal project, this prototype evolved into a comprehensive proof of concept. Please note that it is intended solely to demonstrate feasibility and is not distributed for production use.
